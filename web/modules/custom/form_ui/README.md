# Form UI #

A module to add form UI improvements for Drupal 8.

## Current Functionality ##

This module currently offers:

* Moving descriptive text (for most fields) to before the field rather than after.
* Preventing the default bulk action from being "delete".

## Why does this module exist? ##

This module exists to fix annoyances / what we perceive to be poor UI seen in Drupal 8, hopefully we can keep an eye on this module and remove any functions hooks no longer required.
